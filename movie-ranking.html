<h3>Game of thrones</h3>

    “Game of Thrones offers the special indulgence of vicarious, guilt-free barbarism,” says Freeman. Life in every corner
    of Westeros is completely un-politically correct good guys are killed, bad guys gain power, women are raped and pawned
    about, and people with “differences” are ridiculed and marginalized.

<h3>Wednesday</h3>
<p>every character in Wednesday contributed to the eerie and suspenseful scenery the show takes place in</p>
